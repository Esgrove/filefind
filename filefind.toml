# Paths to index (drives, directories, or network locations).
#
# Can include:
# - Drive letters (e.g., "C:", "D:") - indexes entire drive using fast NTFS MFT scanning
# - Specific directories (e.g., "C:\\Users", "D:\\Projects") - uses MFT scanning but
#   only stores entries under the specified paths (fast AND selective)
# - Mapped network drives (e.g., "Z:") - MFT scanning is attempted first; if not
#   available (most NAS devices), falls back to directory walking automatically
# - UNC paths (e.g., "\\\\server\\share") - uses directory walking (no drive letter)
#
# If empty or not specified, all available local NTFS drives will be auto-detected.
# Network drives are NOT auto-detected - add them explicitly if needed.
#
# Examples:
# paths = ["C:", "D:"]                                    # Index entire local drives
# paths = ["C:\\Users\\Me\\Documents", "D:\\Projects"]   # Index specific directories
# paths = ["C:", "Z:"]                                   # Local drive + mapped NAS
# paths = ["C:", "\\\\nas\\media"]                       # Local drive + UNC path
# paths = []
